# Alpha Rules

## Model Profiles
Model profiles are simple and have the following elements:  
- **Health:** Amount of Wounds the model can suffer before being eliminated.
- **Move:** Base number of spaces the model can move when taking a Move action.
- **Skill:** The "To Hit" value on a dice the model most roll equal to or higher when making any skill based test such as Ranged Attack, Melee Attack, etc.
- **Willpower:** The "To Hit" value when making Willpower saves.
- **Defense:** The amount of damage automatically canceled whenever being attacked by another model.
- **Cost:** The cost of adding the model to your team when building a Force.
- **Faction:** Faction the model belongs to.
- **Traits:** Special rules that apply to the model.
- **Weapons:** One or more weapon profiles describing the number of dice and any other effects, such as Range and Shots, when making basic attacks.

## Cards
Unique abilities for models are not part of their main profile, but instead depicted on separate cards. When a model is recruited to your Force, all of the ability cards provided by the model are added to the player deck. 
Cards are used in the Advanced Game only. Players build a custom deck of cards when builing a Force, using a pool of cards determined by the Faction and models that make up their Force. 



## Resources
Most factions use Grit as a resource. Some factions use an alternative resource to Grit, such as Sanity, Rage, Ambition, etc.

## Factions
When building a Force, players pick a Faction, which determines which models the player may recruit into their Force. Factions are designed to play distinctly from one another and sometimes offer their own game mechanics.

### Beast Factions
There are multiple Beast Factions, grouped by the native World of the Beasts which dwell there (Old West, Feudal Japan, Cynder, etc.). Players may not mix Beasts from different native Worlds. 

Players fielding a Beast faction for their Force get to pick the map on which the scenario will be played. Beasts have special affinity with their environment and get to fight on their "home turf", able to use the terrain of their native world in special ways.

When both opponents are playing a Beast Faction, each player bids until one side passes. The winner plays in their native world.

### The Void
The Void faction features creatures from the Void. The Void does not use Grit as a resource, but instead uses Sanity as a resource. The Void is the only faction that may apply their resource (Sanity) to Enemy Models.

The Void is immune to Corruption.

### Serpentmen

### Targa Defense

### Crimson Hand

### Takobake

### Army of the Dragon King

### Black Fang Tribe

### Scafford Gang



## Maps
Uses the same rules for Frontier Town and Feudal Japan for movement, line of sight, cover, etc.

## Combat

### Sanity
Sanity does not work like Health the way it does for Heroes in the base game. Instead, models accumulate Sanity which acts as a penalty.
